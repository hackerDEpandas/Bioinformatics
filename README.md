# Bioinformatics

The following repository are solutions to problems given by the good people at [ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). You can find the problem set under the [Bioinformatics Stronghold](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/). **Note** that the solutions are done in an object oriented manner for my personal practice only. I admit that some of these solutions could be done differently with significantly less lines of code, however I just want to practice a different style.
